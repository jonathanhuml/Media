I'll be continually adding to this repository as I get more ideas. The scenemarker.py script cuts up movies into gifs (or regular videos) for shot-by-shot analysis. Because I enjoy reading movie scripts, I'm also in the process of scraping a bunch of scripts online and finding a better way to recommend scripts I might want to read with a simple recommendation system. 
This is what the books Jupyter notebook file does. It takes in a "like list" and turns it into a graph with the Goodreads API. Then we do some graph clustering to find which books are most similar. It's very simple but seems to work decently.
