# Movies
I'll be continually adding to this repository as I get more ideas. The scenemarker.py script cuts up movies into gifs (or regular videos) for shot-by-shot analysis. Because I enjoy reading movie scripts, I'm also in the process of scraping a bunch of scripts online and finding a better way to recommend scripts I might want to read with a simple recommendation system.
